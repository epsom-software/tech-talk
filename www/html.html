        <ol>
            <li>Why does JavaScript seem to be in demand, more so than other languages currently?</li>
            <li>Can you give us a better understanding of how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Grunt etc. come together when writing code?</li>
            <li>What is the current comparison made by companies between React/ Angular and which specific factors would make either suit one type of industry (comparing speed/ performance)?</li>
            <li>Is there a visible difference between React &amp; Angular builds to the naked eye (could a recruiter recognise these without looking at the codebase)?</li>
            <li>Please define an SPA, WebApp, Mobile first, Website in relation to JavaScript &amp; the differences in approach.</li>
            <li>What can we look for on a web page/ app to help highlight complex Javascript work as opposed to the easier type of stuff.</li>
            <li>Can you conceptualise how a UI talks to the Api and represents data?</li>
            <li>What Framework do you think will be most popular moving forward and why?</li>
            <li>Is there a legitimate reason (and alternative option) for a company not to choose JavaScript?</li>
        </ol>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <!--<script src="jquery.js"></script><script src="js.js"></script>-->
